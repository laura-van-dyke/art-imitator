# Art Imitator

Developed by Laura Van Dyke

Thank you for checking out Art Imitator. This project uses machine learning models to incorporate artistic elements into plain images. Each model is trained on a single painting using Logan Engstrom's style transfer convolutional neural network.

Users are invited to upload their own images to see them transformed by the deep neural network into works of art.
