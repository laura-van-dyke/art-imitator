# Art Imitator

Developed by Laura Van Dyke

Thank you for checking out Art Imitator where users can upload their own images to see them transformed by a deep neural network into works of art.

This project uses machine learning models to incorporate artistic elements into plain images. Each model has been trained on a single painting using Logan Engstrom's style transfer convolutional neural network.
